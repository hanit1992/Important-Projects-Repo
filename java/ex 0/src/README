=          Design           =
=============================
the main design of the program is a direct order instructed in the mission ex0 file,
so there was not much design choice of the specific program.
i can only say that i chose not to add any sub classes, because i found the constructed
design satisfying and logical. i managed to use the given classes and methods and implement
the assigment from them alone.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
by implementing the methods of the requested classes, i tried to be as simple as possible,
and to use as much as i could the other methods for a certain method who required exactly
what they did. i gave readable variable names, who were a logical representation of the thing
itself.
