this project is a self experience of mine with mostly Java's gui, which i had no experience using during the other projects. 
mostly learned how to use java's packages for this purpse, and how to manage a filter mechanizem.

this projects supports managing a virtual reciepe book with the option to filter and search receipes by choice.
