OpenHashSet.java - a class represents the Open hash set data structure.
ClosedHashSet.java - a class represents the Closed hash set data structure.
SimpleHashSetPerformanceAnalyzer.java - the class in order to execute tests of the different structures.
LinkedListWrapper.java - wraps the java's linked list for OpenHashSet to use.
CollectionFacadeSet.java - implements the SimpleSet interface for java's data structures.
SimpleSet.java - the interface to implement by OpenHashSet,ClosedHashSet and the facade class.

=          Design           =
=============================
most of the design in this exercise was chosen by the school, but i maid the following decisions for the design:
-i decided to make SimpleHashSet an abstract class, and to implement the add and contain methods in the inherited
classes. this decision was maid because of the difference in the implementation of the closed structure and the open
structure, specificely considering the 'contain' and 'add' and 'delete' methods.
-i decided to implement the linked list that OpenHashSet is using with, by a wrapping class called 'LinkedListWrapper'.
this class holds all the methods which will be used by the OpenHashSet class linked list. it supports the methods
add,contain,delete and creating an iterator. because this class will create a new object (link list) in Open set
class only when a new value needs to be added to the array, i decided that the constructor will imediatly call
the class's add function with a given string value.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
-OpenHashSet table - i decided to implement the table according to the main idea of the open set - by link lists which
will be in each cell of the main array. the array will be a regular java array, who will hold objects of the wrapping
class LinkedListWrapper (as described in the design section). when a new string needs to be added to the set, and in
it's index spot is null, a new linked list wrapper object will be created, by calling the wrapper class and from than on
calling the class's methods in order to control the lists objects.
-ClosedHashSet deletion - i decided to implement the deletion as follows:
 in the constructor, i created a new String object, that will be construct from some 'deleted string' i decided on.
 whenever i erase a string from a cell in the table, i'm setting instead the deleted string value. that way,
 in the contains method, i distinguish between the reference equality and the contant equality:
 because i created a new String Object, and set the empty cell to this string, i created a cell that is connected by
 reference to this Object String. i'm asking, than, a the contain method, if the cell points to this string, meanning -
 does this cell has thr reference of the String? i'm using the "==" that checks the reference equality.
 to distinguish this string or just a similar string who is taking regular place in this table, i'm checking for
 a contant  equality - by "equals()" method, and in that way i can tell when is this cell is pointing to the erased
 string, and when this cell in the string itself.
 in this way, in the contain method, i can go through all the list, and keep going if the cell in anything but null
 (if has a value, or marked as erased) and stop whenever reaches null. in the add method, i will check if a cell is
 null or if it's marked as erased, and will fill it accordingly.

-discussing the analyse results-
#the bad results are:
-OpenHashSet: initializing data1, contains of the negative number in data1.
-CloseHashSet: initializing data1, contains of the negative number in data1.
#-OpenHashSet:
  strengths: adding new data when the data doesn't have the same hash, finding a positive int.
  weaknesses: adding new data when the data have the same hash, finding a long negative int.
 -ClosedHashSet:
  strengths: finding a positive int in a list not with the same hash, adding new data when the data doesn't
  have the same hash
  weaknesses: adding new data when the data have the same hash, searching for a big negative number
  when the hash is the same.
 -HashSet:
  strengths: adding new data from any kind, searching for a negative large int, searching for values in general.
  weaknesses: took a little more to find something when all the words go to the same hash.
 -TreeSet:
  strengths: adding new data from any kind.
  weaknesses: comparing to hash set, takes a little more to search for values, but the difference is not that big.
 -LinkedList:
  strengths: finding a short int
  weaknesses: everything else... really slow in adding data, searching particularly.
 in order to add data i would choose java's Hash set, and i would choose it in order to do everything else. it has a
 keen strength in those checked fields.
#it seems like the open hash is better. it has better performances in adding both data's, and it finds values faster,
except for one specific one - and this just can be related to the specific spot of the data in the set.
#java's Hash set was almost always better. in some contains operations the results of HashSet and the open hash were
 pretty close, so i guess that when it comes to add values, java's hash is very efficient.
#i wasn't surprised by the difference between the close set and the open when it comes to adding values. it was clair to
me that the open structure can reach the matching places faster. i was surprised by how much the LinkedList was weak
comparing the others.
#i found it really surprising.i suspect that their probing function is much better, and also the hash function. it mostly
seem like it finds spots in the set faster, so maybe it's even indicates that it holds liked lists like in our open set.
#i didn't try it. i followed one function through all the exam.
